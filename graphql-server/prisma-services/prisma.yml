# Seeds are implicitly executed when deploying a service for the first time
# (unless explicitly disabled using the --no-seed flag on prisma deploy).

# Right now, the best workflow to "start from scratch" + seeding is this:
#   prisma seed --reset
seed:
  import: ./seed.graphql
  # run: node script.js
